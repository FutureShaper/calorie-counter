   - Select your development team from the "Team" dropdown
   - Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked
   - Your Bundle Identifier should be unique (e.g., `com.yourname.CalorieCounter`)

3. **Verify Deployment Target**:
   - In "General" tab, ensure "Deployment Target" is set to iOS 17.0 or later
   - Check that the iOS version matches your target device/simulator

#### 3. API Key Configuration

Choose one of these methods to configure your OpenAI API key:

**Method A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
1. In Xcode, go to Product ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme...
2. Select "Run" in the left panel
3. Click on "Arguments" tab
4. Under "Environment Variables", click "+"
5. Set Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and Value: `your-actual-api-key`

**Method B: Build Settings**
1. Select your project target
2. Go to "Build Settings" tab
3. Click "+" and choose "Add User-Defined Setting"
4. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Value: `your-actual-api-key`

**Method C: Xcode Configuration File** (Advanced)
1. Create a new file: File ‚Üí New ‚Üí File...

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Build Errors

**"No such module 'UIKit'" or similar**:
- Ensure iOS Deployment Target is set correctly (iOS 17.0+)
- Clean build folder: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)

**Code Signing Issues**:
- Verify your Apple ID is added: Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
- Select your development team in Signing & Capabilities
- Try changing Bundle Identifier to something unique

**API Key Not Working**:
- Verify the API key is set correctly in your chosen configuration method
- Check the OpenAI API key is valid in your OpenAI dashboard
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

#### Simulator Issues

**Simulator Not Starting**:
- Restart Xcode and try again
- Reset Simulator: Device ‚Üí Erase All Content and Settings
- Try a different simulator device

**Camera Not Available in Simulator**:
- The camera functionality requires a physical device
- Use photo library option instead for testing in simulator

#### Device Deployment Issues

**"App installation failed"**:
- Ensure device is connected and trusted
- Verify your Apple Developer account has device provisioning
- Check that iOS version on device matches deployment target

**"Untrusted Developer"**:
- On device: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
- Trust your developer certificate

### Additional Xcode Tips

- **Use Simulator for Initial Testing**: Test basic functionality without needing a physical device
- **Enable Automatic Signing**: Simplifies certificate management for development
- **Check Console Output**: Use Xcode's console to debug API calls and app behavior
- **Breakpoint Debugging**: Set breakpoints in Swift code to step through logic
- **Preview in Xcode**: Use SwiftUI previews for rapid UI development

### Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera Access**: To take photos of food
- **HealthKit Access**: To read/write nutrition data

## Current Implementation

### OpenAI Vision Integration
The app now uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze food images and extract macro nutrient information:
- Sends food photos to OpenAI's vision API
- Uses an optimized prompt to extract protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber amounts
- Receives structured JSON responses with nutrition data
- Falls back to simulated data if API is unavailable

### API Configuration
- **Secure In-App Configuration**: Users can configure API keys through a native settings interface
- **iOS Keychain Integration**: Credentials stored securely using iOS Keychain Services
- **Multiple Configuration Methods**: Supports Keychain, environment variables, and build settings
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to simulated data when API is not available
- See [SECURE_CONFIGURATION.md](SECURE_CONFIGURATION.md) for complete setup guide

### Legacy ML Support (Available for Extension)
The `MLModelManager` is designed to be easily extended with Core ML models:
1. Add a trained Core ML model file to the project
2. Update `loadCoreMLModel()` to load your model
3. Implement local inference alongside OpenAI integration

### Sample Nutrition Data
The app currently recognizes these sample foods:
- Grilled Chicken Breast
- Brown Rice Bowl
- Mixed Green Salad
- Salmon Fillet
- Quinoa Bowl
- Greek Yogurt
- Avocado Toast

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ContentView**: Main UI orchestrating photo capture, analysis, and health data saving
2. **PhotoPickerView**: Handles camera and photo library access
3. **MLModelManager**: Manages food recognition and nutrition estimation
4. **HealthKitManager**: Handles all HealthKit operations
5. **NutritionModel**: Data structures for nutrition information

### Data Flow

1. User takes/selects food photo
2. `MLModelManager` analyzes image ‚Üí nutrition data
3. Results displayed in UI
4. User saves to Health app via `HealthKitManager`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with real Core ML food recognition model
- [ ] Food database for improved nutrition accuracy
- [ ] Portion size estimation
- [ ] Meal tracking and history
- [ ] Nutritional goals and recommendations
- [ ] Barcode scanning for packaged foods
- [ ] Social sharing features
